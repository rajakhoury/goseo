# Privacy Policy for GoSEO

**Last updated: January 19, 2025**

## Data Collection

GoSEO does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. All SEO analysis happens locally in your browser.

## What We Don't Collect

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Website content you analyze
- Any usage analytics or tracking data

## Local Storage

The extension uses browser local storage only to save your preferences:
- Theme selection (light/dark mode)
- Keyword density threshold settings

This data never leaves your device and is only accessible by the extension.

## Network Requests

GoSEO makes network requests only when:
- Checking for broken links (optional feature you trigger)
- Loading external resources referenced in the page you're analyzing

These requests are made directly by your browser and are not logged or tracked by us.

## Third-Party Services

GoSEO does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version here with an updated date.
